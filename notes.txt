TODO:


-text augmentation https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug
-Concat the CLS token with the pooled embeddings in BERT
- Transitive closure
- DALI
- Efficientnet
- Triplet loss
- Clip https://www.kaggle.com/bguberfain/openai-clip-with-train
- OCR https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/discussion/224543
Checked:
-PHASH: on validation only add a single TP and a single FP
-Fusing: .867 vs .870 weaving
